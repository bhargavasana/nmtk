    "text":"\n<P>This tool implements a predictive model of Pedestrian Volume estimated using an Ordinary Least Squares (simple\nlinear) regression method.  The volumes estimated cover a 12-hour period (morning to evening).</P>\n<P>The model is based on a combination of environmental and demographic factors that showed a relationship with observed\nlevels of pedestrian activity.  The model may be applied to road and trail segments.  For &ldquo;average&rdquo; facilities, this\ntool will generate plausible estimates, but it does not deal well with outliers, and some facilities may show &ldquo;negative&rdquo;\nvalues.  This model is most useful for evaluating the relative level of activity that would be expected under different\nconditions.</P>\n<P>We have included the Ordinary Least Squares pedestrian model in the Non-Motorized Toolkit primarily for completeness\n(all models in the UMN report linked in the tool documentation have been implemented).  You should use the Negative\nBinomial version of the model (which forces values not to be negative) if you would prefer to see results that only\ncontain positive numbers, and that thus might be directly compared to your own counts.</P>\n<P>The coefficients for the model were estimated by a team from the University of Minnesota (UMN) based on counts\ncollected in Minneapolis, and published by the UMN Center for Transportation Studies in July 2012.  The model\nimplementation presented here was developed by the Open Technology Group (Morrisville, NC) under contract with the\nFederal Highway Administration.</P>\n<P>The full report on the study and model development is available in the tool documentation links.</P>\n",
