This directory contains fonts used by the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to generate legends for WMS services.

In particular, when WMS services are generated we compute a related legend graphic, and use one or more of
the fonts in this directory to generate it/them.  Note that the font itself is referenced in the settings.py file
used by Django
