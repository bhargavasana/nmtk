The two files in this directory (celeryd-nmtk.init and celeryd-nmtk.default)
need to be modified and copied into /etc/init.d and /etc/default, respectively.

Modify celeryd-nmtk.init so that the "provides" line matches the name of
the init script.  For example, if the script is called celeryd-mytest
then the provides line should contain 'celeryd-mytest' .  This is required,
especially if you intend to run more than a single celery server on a single
host.

Next, modify the celeryd-nmtk.default file so that it contains
the appropriate location for your vhost.

Lastly, copy both files to their respective locations, as noted above.  Make 
sure that:

 1.  Both files start with celeryd-
 3.  The portion of the filename *after* celeryd- are the same.

For example, you can use the following names:

   celeryd-nmtk.init     --> /etc/init.d/celeryd-myserver
   celeryd-nmtk.default  --> /etc/default/celeryd-myserver
